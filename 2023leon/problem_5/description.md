Neptune has 14 satellites, but almost nobody knows the order of proximity to the planet because,
among other reasons, their orbital excentricities are very different and the order changes
depending on the orbital location. It's generally agreed that the order of the fourteen Neptune
moons (starting by the closest one) is Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, Galatea, Larissa, Hippocamp,
Proteus, Triton, Nereid, Halimede, Sao, Laomedeia, Psamathe and Neso.
