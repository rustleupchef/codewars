An alien race called the Literalites has arrived to Earth. They had no trouble learning our languages,
however they have the "problem" that they always interpret everything in a literal sense. So,
whenever they see one of our acronyms that include a number and then some letters, they think
its meaning is to repeat the letters as many times as the precedent number states. For example,
when they see "4K" (for the resolution), they think it means "KKKK". And when they see 5G (for the
mobile network speed), they think it means "GGGGG". Same for other acronyms like "1080p" (for
number of lines in a screen) or "30fps" (for frames per second).

### Description
You are asked to write a program that takes one of those acronyms and outputs what the aliens
will interpret. See examples below.

### Input
An acronym like "720p" or "3G".

### Output
The interpretation by the aliens. For example, for "3G" it would be "GGG".
