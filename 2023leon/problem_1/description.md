Now is the time to prove that you have what it takes to be a true warrior. Now is the time to start
coding and having fun! As a rite of passage, you must create your very first program in this journey.
However, we are feeling generous today, so we will not ask you to do something too difficult. For
now you only have to write a program that takes no input and returns the string "Welcome to
Codewars 2023!".

### Description

No input for this problem.
```
### Output
