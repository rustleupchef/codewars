extend your first program a bit, so it takes a team name (like the name of your team, but it can be
any arbitrary string) and outputs the string Welcome to Codewars 2023, TeamName!, where
TeamName is the name of the team you input.

### Description

TeamName is the name of the team you input.

you input.
